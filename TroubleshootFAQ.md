## Host computer requirements
A host PC running Ubuntu 14.04 Linux is recommended for building code, debugging and testing the Snapdragon Flight™ board (newer versions of the OS may work too but may not be tested / supported).

## Revive board that will not boot
If your Snapdragon™ Flight board does not boot up, you may be able to recover it in one of the following ways:

### Factory reset  
This is documented in the "Factory reset" chapter of the Snapdragon Flight User Guide: http://support.intrinsyc.com/documents/125  

### Fastboot mode
With a *serial console adapter* board (see [here](http://shop.intrinsyc.com/products/snapdragon-flight-dev-kit) for details). Use the following procedure to recover the Snapdragon Flight board:  
  1. Disconnect power and USB cable(s) from the Snapdragon Flight and adapter boards.  
  2. Plug the serial console adapter board into the Snapdragon Flight board.  
  3. Enable (insert jumper) J2 (FASTBOOT) of the *serial console adapter* board.  
  4. Connect the debug board’s 3-pin serial port to the computer’s USB port, using the provided USB-to-serial cable, and open a serial terminal (CuteCom or Putty).  
  5. Power up the Snapdragon Flight board.  
  6. Connect the Snapdragon Flight board to the computer via a USB cable.  
  7. Validate the connection by typing “fastboot devices” on a command prompt or terminal window. You should now see the device-specific random number displayed.  
  8. You should be able to flash the platform software images at this point.

To boot the board normally again, perform the following steps:  
  1. Unplug the power supply and USB cable.  
  2. Remove the jumper from FSTBT (J2) on the serial console adapter board.  
  3. Power up the Snapdragon Flight board and connect the board to the computer via a USB cable.  
  4. Validate the connection by typing “adb devices” on a command prompt or terminal window.

*NOTE:* If none of the above options work, please contact [support](https://www.intrinsyc.com/contact-support) to get it reflashed.

## Serial console adapter board  
The serial console adapter board and cable are available as part of the [Snapdragon Flight developer's edition](http://shop.intrinsyc.com/collections/product-development-kits/products/snapdragon-flight-dev-kit). This allows the board to be accessed through a USB connector for debugging purposes. It also provides jumpers to force the board in fastboot and other special modes if necessary.

### Older versions
Some customers may have received an older deprecated version of the serial console adapter board does not include the fastboot jumper support. Please look at the MCN printed on the board to identify it:
  - 25-H9563 - Older serial console board, it does not include the fastboot jumper pins
  - 25-H9916 - New serial console board, it includes the fastboot jumper pins (J4)  

If you have the older version, please contact [support](https://www.intrinsyc.com/contact-support) to get the newer Serial Console Adapter board.

### Pin compatibility issues
Some serial console adapter parts have all 4 pins on the header whereas they should only have 3. If you have such a part, please *clip pin 2* on the header. This allows the FTDI serial cable to be inserted in only 1 way as below:
 
Pin 1 (TXD) Orange  
Pin 3 (RXD) Yellow  
Pin 4 (GND) Black

## apt-get does not work  
Ensure that the Snapdragon Flight board is configured in [Station mode](http://dev.px4.io/advanced-snapdragon.html#station-mode) and connected to the Internet: 

apt-get on Snapdragon Flight is broken. We need the following work-around to install packages:

Uninstall certain on-board packages in order to get apt-get to work. 
```apt-get install -f```

Install the package(s) that you want using apt-get.

Reinstall the previously-uninstalled packages as follows:
```shell  
mkdir temp-mount  
mount /dev/mmcblk0p12 temp-mount/  
cd temp-mount
dpkg -i fastcv-internal_1.0-r0_armhf.deb  
dpkg -i mm-camera-lib-prebuilt_1.0 
```

## Install OpenCV  
The standard way to install OpenCV is: ```apt-get install --fix-missing libopencv-highgui-dev```

Since apt-get on Snapdragon Flight is broken, we need to use the following work-around:

Uninstall certain installed packages in order to get apt-get to work, and then install OpenCV.
```shell  
apt-get install -f  
apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install libglib2.0-dev  
apt-get install --fix-missing libopencv-highgui-dev
```

Reinstall the previously-uninstalled packages as follows:
```shell
mkdir temp-mount  
mount /dev/mmcblk0p12 temp-mount/  
cd temp-mount
dpkg -i fastcv-internal_1.0-r0_armhf.deb  
dpkg -i mm-camera-lib-prebuilt_1.0 
```

## WiFi network connection  
To connect Snapdragon Flight board to a WiFi router on the network, please follow these instructions (see Station mode under Wifi-settings):  
http://dev.px4.io/advanced-snapdragon.html

## Wired ethernet connection  
The board can be connected to the network over a wired connection via the OTG USB port by using a USB Ethernet adapter (such as http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC704LL/A/apple-usb-ethernet-adapter) along with a USB 2.0 Female to Micro USB Male OTG adapter (such as http://www.rakuten.com/prod/268480078.html).

## USB3 cable  
Any standard USB micro-B cable may be used with the board. But in order to get USB 3.0 SuperSpeed functionality, one requires a MICRO-A PLUG TO STD-A cable (such as the Amphenol RUB30-0075 http://www1.amphenol-ast.com/v3/en/product_view.aspx?id=189).

## Camera image is rotated  
On some of the newer boards, the 4K camera images are rotated by 90 degrees. This is a known issue. A software resolution is being worked on and will be provided shortly.

## USB-to-serial debug cable
The USB-to-Serial Debug Cable that plugs into the Serial Console Adapter is the TTL-232R-3V3 part from FTDI modified to be 4-pins and keying added to prevent incorrect insertion. For more information, see http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf.

## Debugging ADB problems
  - Verify that the Snapdragon Flight target is listed when you type ```adb devices``` on the host computer?
  - Do ```ls -l /etc/udev/rules.d``` and check for the existance of the 51-android.rules file.
  - Verify that the following lines are present in your ```/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules``` file? If not, add them and try again.
```
#for Device adb interface
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="05c6", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
#for Fastboot bootloader interface
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="18d1", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
```
  - Do ```lsusb``` on the host PC after the Snapdragon Flight board is connected and powered up. You must see an entry for the target (usually listed as ```Qualcomm, Inc. Qualcomm HSUSB Device```).
  - Do ```adb kill-server``` and then ```adb start-server``` and try again?
  - If none of this works, verify that adb is functional on your host computer by connecting a phone or other device.

## Unable to flash platform BSP
If you're unable to flash the platform BSP using the [intructions here](http://support.intrinsyc.com/projects/snapdragon-flight/wiki/Get_and_install_the_latest_platform_BSP), please try the following:
- Execute the jflash script as root

## Debugging IMU issues
Do the following steps if you experience issues that may be due to IMU data. This is a test utility to verify that IMU data is being received correctly.

On the host machine via a separate terminal (*optional*):
``` ${HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT}/tools/mini-dm/Linux_Debug/mini-dm ```

On the target:

```shell
cd /usr/bin

# Run the imu_app (in the background)
./imu_app &
 
# Run the sensor_imu_tester app for 'n' seconds
./sensor_imu_tester <n>
## It should run and then say "test completed..."
## It should log the IMU data in a file called IMU_*.txt
 
# Stop the imu_app
VAR=$(ps -eaf | grep imu_app | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d' ' -f2); kill $VAR
```

If the IMU_*.txt file was not created or the IMU data in it does not look correct, please try the following:
- Ensure that you installed the latest versions platform BSP and flight controller addon from [here] (http://support.intrinsyc.com/projects/snapdragon-flight).
- Post your issue on the [QDN forum](https://developer.qualcomm.com/forums/hardware/snapdragon-flight) with a snippet of the target console log as well as the log from mini-dm.

## GPS support
The on-board GPS module on the Snapdragon Flight™ is *not* supported. Please check this page for other options: https://dev.px4.io/hardware-snapdragon.html
