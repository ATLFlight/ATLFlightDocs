2. Navigate to the mini-dm executable location:
``` ${HEXAGON_INSTALL_HOME}/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/3.0/tools/debug/mini-dm/Linux_Debug ```
3. Connect the USB cable from the Snapdragon Flight board to the host machine where the mini-dm is installed.
4. Run the mini-dm using the following command: ``` ./mini-dm ``` OR ```mini-dm.exe```
